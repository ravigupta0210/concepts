# Good Practices for Software Development

## Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?

Two points that were new to me are:

1. **Make Time:** Investing time in understanding your company, the product you are working on, and your team. This approach emphasizes the importance of building a strong connection with your organization and colleagues, leading to better communication and a more cohesive work environment. Although I knew the importance of teamwork, I had not considered the proactive effort required to deepen this understanding and its potential impact on productivity and collaboration.

2. **Track Time:** The suggestion to use productivity apps like Boosted to monitor and improve time management was new to me. While I have always been conscious of managing my time effectively, utilizing a dedicated app to track and analyze my time usage offers a more structured and data-driven approach to enhancing productivity. These apps can provide insights into how I spend my time, identify areas for improvement, and help establish better work habits.

## Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

Two areas I believe I need to improve on are managing my food and exercise routines, and separating work time from leisure time.

1. **Manage Food and Exercise:** Ensuring balanced nutrition and regular exercise to maintain energy and concentration levels is something I need to work on. Often, I find myself skipping meals or opting for unhealthy snacks, which affects my productivity and energy levels throughout the day. To improve in this area, I plan to:

   - **Plan Meals:** Prepare a weekly meal plan with balanced, nutritious meals to avoid unhealthy eating habits.
   - **Regular Exercise:** Set a fixed time each day for exercise, whether it's a morning jog, a yoga session, or a workout at the gym.
   - **Hydration:** Keep a water bottle at my desk to ensure I stay hydrated throughout the day.
   - **Healthy Snacks:** Replace junk food with healthier snack options like fruits, nuts, and yogurt.

2. **Work and Play:** Separating work time from leisure time to maintain focus is another area I need to improve. I often find myself blending work with personal time, leading to reduced efficiency and increased stress. To address this, I plan to:

   - **Set a Schedule:** Create a clear work schedule and stick to it, ensuring there are defined hours for work and leisure.
   - **Dedicated Workspace:** Establish a specific area in my home for work to physically separate work from personal activities.
   - **Breaks:** Take regular breaks during work hours to rest and recharge, avoiding burnout.
   - **After-Work Routine:** Develop a routine to unwind after work, such as reading, going for a walk, or engaging in a hobby.
